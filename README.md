# In Memory Database for API With Entity Framework Core

##### We're going to use Entity Framework Core's InMemory Provider to create a working "database" in memory for API.

##### This makes it possible to prototype applications and write tests without having to set up a local or external database. When youâ€™re ready to switch to using a real database, you can simply swap in your actual provider.

*I have attached Postman Test Data Request file.*
